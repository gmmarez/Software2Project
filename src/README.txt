Purpose: Create a functional scheduling application in the setting of a doctor's office. This will serve a portal for users
to be able to verify login and manipulate customer records and appointments to their corresponding Contacts. Users will
also be able to view data of all Appointments according to Contacts, Appointments by Customers, and count of Types of
Appointments in table form. The application will also be able to notify the user if an upcoming appointment is scheduled,
change login screen language depending on user location, keep record of all login attempts, and provide input validation.
